# Aussie Estates

This repository contains a minimal boardgame.io configuration for an Australian-themed property trading game. It demonstrates a simple setup with two phases:

- **Buy** – players can roll dice and purchase the property they land on.
- **EndGame** – triggered after 20 turns, awarding victory to the richest player.

See `server/game/index.ts` for the implementation.
