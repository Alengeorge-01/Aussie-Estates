# Aussie Estates

This repository contains the source code for **Aussie Estates**, a multiplayer Australian property trading game. The project uses Next.js with TypeScript on the client and a Node server powered by boardgame.io.

Due to the restricted environment no npm dependencies are installed. The file tree and basic TypeScript scaffolding are provided so the project can be set up in a full development environment.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies once network access is available:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development servers:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The client will start on `localhost:3000` and the game server on `localhost:4000` by default.
